# Hi, I'm Ryan Yin

## I use optimization and operations research to power smarter decisions in tech, business, and beyond.

### About Me
I'm a sophomore at The Village School in Houston, TX.
I'm someone who loves thinking in systems, optimizing workflows, and solving messy problems — whether through code, strategy, or good old trial and error.

Lately, I've been exploring operations research, applied math, and startup design — figuring out how smart processes and great tools can make life simpler, faster, or just cooler.

But outside of school and projects, I'm pretty much everywhere:

🎮 Playing Brawlhalla (Platinum) or Fortnite (Unreal)
🏸 Getting competitive with badminton, tennis, football, pickleball, and random gym PRs
🎾 Coaching tennis
🎧 Listening to NIKI and vibing to late-night lo-fi playlists
🥩 Perfecting my steak-searing skills — cast iron > nonstick

I like building things, improving things, and making things that last. Whether it's launching a new project, running an AAU basketball team, or writing late at night — I'm always chasing that next idea worth committing to.

Let's build something cool.
