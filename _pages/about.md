Hi! I'm Ryan Yin — a sophomore at The Village School in Houston, TX.  
I’m someone who loves thinking in systems, optimizing workflows, and solving messy problems — whether through code, strategy, or good old trial and error.

Lately, I've been exploring **operations research**, **applied math**, and **startup design** — figuring out how smart processes and great tools can make life simpler, faster, or just cooler.

But outside of school and projects, I’m pretty much everywhere:
- 🎮 Playing **Brawlhalla (Platinum)** or **Fortnite (Unreal)**
- 🏸 Getting competitive with **badminton, tennis, football, pickleball**, and random gym PRs
- 🎾 Coaching little kids in tennis (nothing teaches patience like this)
- 🎧 Listening to **NIKI** and vibing to late-night lo-fi playlists
- 🥩 Perfecting my steak-searing skills — cast iron > nonstick

I like building things, improving things, and making things that last. Whether it's launching a new project, running an AAU basketball team, or writing late at night — I’m always chasing that next idea worth committing to.

Let’s build something cool.
